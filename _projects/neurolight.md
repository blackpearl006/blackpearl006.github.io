## üì¶ Project Structure

- **sex_classification.ipynb**  
  Beginner-friendly notebook for sex classification using PyTorch.  
  Step-by-step guide with dataset, model, and workflow.  
  See the [Medium Tutorial](https://medium.com/@daminininad/intro-to-ai-with-neuroimaging-data-a-end-to-end-tutorial-using-pytorch-f941c6ef547a) for a detailed walkthrough.

- **crossvalidation_sexclassification.py**  
  Implements K-Fold Cross Validation for robust model evaluation.  
  Run independently to assess generalization.

- **ddp_sex.py**  
  Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) script for efficient multi-GPU training.  
  Run with:  `torchrun ‚Äìstandalone ‚Äìnproc_per_node=7 ddp_sex.py`

Requires correct folder structure and dependencies.

- **/data**  
- `dataset.py`: Dataset class for loading and preprocessing.
- `dataloader.py`: Handles batching, shuffling, and data loaders.

- **/utils**  
- `trainer.py`: Training loop, forward/backward passes, evaluation.
- `visualisation.py`: Visualizes training loss, confusion matrices, and more.

- **/models**  
Model architectures:
- SFCN (Shallow Fully Connected Network)
- ResNet

- **/configs**  
- `config.yaml`: Hyperparameters and model settings.

- **requirements.txt**  
Python dependencies. Install with:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
