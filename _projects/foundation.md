Inspired by modern LLMs, this project explores building **foundation models** that can integrate **multimodal neuroimaging** data.  

We're following resources like:
- [MIT Intro to Deep Learning](https://introtodeeplearning.com/)
- [Stanford CS336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/)
- [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_)


_Results and code will be released soon._
