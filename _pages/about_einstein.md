I am a traveler at heart, drawn to the excitement and curiosity that research brings. My research areas span computer vision and medical imaging, where I explore the intersection of technology and human health. 

Alongside my research, I am a part-time web developer, focusing on creating innovative platforms that bridge gaps in scientific communication. [NeuroDataHub](https://blackpearl006.github.io/NeuroDataHub/)

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in [foundation modeling](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/) for large language models (LLMs) and their applications in medical image analysis, aiming to contribute to the evolving landscape of AI in healthcare.
