I was honored to be invited as a resource person for the Two Day National Workshop on “TOPOLOGY FOR DATA ANALYSIS,” organized by the Dept. of Basic Science & Humanities on 06 & 07 January, 2025, in Kochi. The workshop saw participation from nearly 70 attendees, including faculty members, research scholars, and postgraduate students from across the state and beyond.

During the event, I shared our recent research on utilizing topological features to identify Alzheimer’s disease, which has been published in ICPR and Frontiers. Additionally, I conducted a hands-on tutorial for the participants on extracting topological features using the Ripser Python library.

Other resource persons included:
1) Dr. Vinodkumar P B, Research Professor, MITS, Varikoli.

2) Dr. Amit Chattopadhyay, Associate Professor, IIIT Bengaluru.

3) Prof. Neelam Sinha, Associate Professor, IISC Bengaluru.
